# data-process-of-my-paper

Here is the code of the data processing of my graduation thesis.  

I can't provide you the row data, since it may violate the copy right.

Another thing that I feel sorry about is that I write few comments. This is because:  
* I am lazy.....
* I don't know ahead that I would post them online.

Fortunately, they are jupyter notebooks. So you may get more information since jupyter notebooks are interactive.
